                <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method where you break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes long, called "Pomodoros," followed by a 5-minute break. After completing four Pomodoros, you take a longer break, usually 15-30 minutes. It's designed to improve focus and productivity by encouraging short, timed work sessions.<br><br>

              <p>Using a to-do list provides multiple benefits, including improved time management, boosted productivity, reduced stress, and better focus. It helps you stay organized, avoid forgetting tasks, and experience a sense of accomplishment as you complete items. It also supports a healthier work-life balance and the development of good habits, which leads to long-term success. To-do lists give you control over your tasks, allowing you to prioritize, delegate, and achieve goals more efficiently.</p>
